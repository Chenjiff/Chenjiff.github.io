### About Me
Hey, I'm ChenJ, a backend development engineer, a fellow villager in the world of coding, or, more poetically, a practitioner and explorer in the digital world.

As a coder, I'm the type who likes to tap on the keyboard late into the night, turning carbs (including rice and cola) into code â€” my joy comes from building those invisible but crucial things. Here, I build efficient and usable Java/Go APIs, handling complex backend logic; there, I build high-performance offline and online big data pipelines, processing massive amounts of data.

I, or we, are always in pursuit of how to design systems that are not only high-performance and scalable but also maintainable, constantly enhancing our tech stack, constantly striving to find the best solutions amidst rapidly changing business needs.

I believe that code is our tool, and with it, we can not only solve problems but also create the future.
